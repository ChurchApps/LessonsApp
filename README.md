# Lessons.church

> **Lessons.church** is a website for hosting free video based lessons for churches.  The lessons can be scheduled in advance for classrooms and customized.  The companion [Lessons Screen](https://github.com/ChurchApps/LessonsScreen/) app runs on any Android TV device and will pre-fetch each weeks lesson in the classroom so they're ready to be displayed on Sunday without needing an Internet connection.
